### Business Rules

- A productâ€™s quantity must trigger a reorder when it drops below the reorder level.
- A user must be authenticated to place an order.
- One supplier can supply many products.
- An order can contain multiple products, and a product can be in many orders.
- Inventory changes (like reorder, update, or removal) must be logged in `InventoryLog`.
